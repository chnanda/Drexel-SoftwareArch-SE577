# Drexel-SoftwareArch-SE577
Software Architecture Graduate Class (SE577)

I am a full stack developer and recently started pursuing into big data analysis. Been with Comcast for more than 4 years and working on different technologies and streams.

I believe anything that is well architected and planned will have fruitful results, coming to software architecture, I would like to know the best architecture methods, models for different use cases which have been proved, donâ€™t want to reinvent the wheel. And with the current trend I would like to explore and how we can utilize and learn the software architecture methods, and implement the same at my work place.
