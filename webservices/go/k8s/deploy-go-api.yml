      # Just a quick word on imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent, by default kubernetes will try to pull
      # container images from a container repository like docker hub.  Since we are just demoing
      # we manually installed the container inside of kind via the command in the instructions
      # 'kind load docker-image ...' thus this tells the API to check if the container is present
      # and if so use it, if not, find it in the repository.  Also notice i did not tag the image
      # by default it will put ':latest' at the end, best practice is to fix to a tagged image so
      # that the build process is largely ephemeral - eg, .../se577-demo-app:v-1.1
